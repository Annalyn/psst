                      <p>I have worked with youth in a variety of formats from Youth Justice, Street Youth, Foster Children and my own daughters and several of their friends.</p>
                      <p>The common denominator seems to be a lack of personal boundaries (allowing others to control you or treat you unfairly), low self-esteem (lots of negative chatter about yourself), and way too much information provided by social media (what’s true and what is not).</p>
                      <p>I will help you sort through the mass of information, allowing you to take control of your life, your goals and your direction.</p>
                      <p>All you have to do is take the first step. Contact me and we will set up a FREE Initial Consultation. This will take about 30 minutes.</p>

                        <h2>My Life Story...</h2>
                        <p>I was born the 9th of nine children.  My parents were finally living their own love story after years of individual struggle and heart-break.  Life was good.  The final 4 of the 9 children were all living with 2 people who truly loved each other.</p>
                        <p>On a cold December day, just 6 short months after my birth, my mother was holding me gently in her arms, feeding me a bottle when she suffered a sudden and fatal heart attack at the age of 40. </p>
                        <p>She collapsed to the floor, taking me with her.  My sister who was just 21 months old; managed to pull me out and ultimately saved my life.  When Dad came home from work, he was so devastated at the loss of his soul mate that he immediately left, leaving his two tiny little babies at home with their deceased mother lying on the kitchen floor.</p>
                        <p> For the next 4 months, our 2 older sisters would wrap us up in blankets, set us on the front porch of the house on King Street in London, and head off to school. </p>
                        <p>My sisters were afraid of the Truant Officer so they obediently went to school, everyday that winter, while my sister and I stayed huddled up on the front porch of our home.  By March, CAS had caught on to our little story and sent us all to foster care.  We were eventually adopted, while my 2 older sisters remained in care.</p>
                        <p>My sister and I went to live on a farm.  Not so far away, but a very different world.  On the farm, life became normal, with a twist of WTF.  Let’s speed this up a bit….there were diapers, poopy pants, scraped knees, bruised shins, angry parents, scared kids, birthday parties, broken rules, consequences, disappointment and frustration, eventually leading to 2 teenage girls living on their own in a tiny apartment trying to find their way.</p>
                        <p>From there, life presented a few obstacles.  I was married by the age of 20, a mom at 21 and divorced at 22.</p>
                        <p>I immediately entered another relationship, because I didn’t know how to be on my own.  This relationship presented a whole new set of life lessons, but also gave me my second daughter.</p>
                        <p>A few years later I had the pleasure of having my neck broken by an unlicensed Shiatsu Practitioner.   I was stuck in bed, loaded with pain killers for about a year.  This ultimately ended the relationship and I found myself finally struggling to stand on my own 2 feet, with 2 small children.</p>
                        <p>I was forced to return to work, without medical clearance.  Being suddenly thrust in single motherhood was very scary, but ultimately the best thing I ever did.  Fast forward to today.  I am now very happily married to a man I have known since I was 17.  My girls are happy, healthy and strong.  I am happy, healthy and strong.</p>
